# GitHub Preparation for DocuGenius

This document explains the steps taken to prepare the DocuGenius project for GitHub, focusing on removing sensitive information and providing clear setup instructions for new users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Sensitive Information

- Removed hardcoded OpenRouter API keys from all configuration files
- Removed GitHub personal access tokens from configuration files
- Created placeholder environment variables for all sensitive information

### 2. Created Example Configuration Files

- Created `.env.example` with placeholder values for all required environment variables
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use environment variables instead of hardcoded secrets
- Updated `.cursor/mcp.json` to use environment variables instead of hardcoded secrets

### 3. Updated Documentation

- Expanded README.md with clear setup instructions
- Added troubleshooting section focusing on OpenRouter API issues
- Created a Cursor setup guide for MCP integration in `docs/cursor-setup.md`
- Added API testing examples to verify configuration

### 4. Added Security Measures

- Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits of sensitive files
- Added the `clean-for-github.js` script to automatically sanitize configuration files before commits
- Added validation and error handling for API key configuration

## Using the Cleaning Script

Before committing to GitHub, you can run the cleaning script to ensure all sensitive information is removed:

```bash
node clean-for-github.js
```

This script will:
1. Reset `.env` to match `.env.example` with placeholders
2. Update `.cursor/mcp.json` with environment variable placeholders 
3. Update `docker-compose.yml` with environment variable placeholders
4. Create necessary directories like `logs` and `temp`

## Verifying Setup

After pulling from GitHub, new users should:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add their API keys
2. Run the test script to verify their OpenRouter API key
3. Follow the setup instructions in the README

## Important Files

- **`.env.example`**: Template for environment variables
- **`README.md`**: Main documentation with setup instructions
- **`docs/cursor-setup.md`**: Guide for setting up Cursor integration
- **`clean-for-github.js`**: Script to clean sensitive information
- **`test-openrouter.js`**: Test script to verify OpenRouter API key

## OpenRouter API Integration

The application requires a valid OpenRouter API key, which can be obtained from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). The key is used to access AI models for documentation generation.

## Next Steps

1. Review the changes and commit to GitHub
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Consider implementing automated API key validation during setup
4. Consider adding CI/CD for easier deployment
